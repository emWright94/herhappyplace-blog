          A lot of you visiting this page know me in real life, but for those of
          you who don't: hello, I'm Em! I'm converting a school bus into a tiny
          home whilst simultaneously learning to code through a program called
          SheCodes. I had been posting my bus progress on Instagram but got off
          most social media recently. I missed updating my friends and family
          through photos, so I figured might as well test my coding skills and
          put together a website to keep people in the loop! So yeah, welcome to
          the maddness!
          <br /><br />
          A little about me, for those who I don't know: I have three dogs and
          one cat, and my favorite thing is to be outdoors with them. I enjoy
          plants, books, making art, learning new things, jamming out to [often
          nerdy] music, exploring nature, and napping. I plan to live on the
          road with my little animal family once the bus is complete. The idea
          is we'll live nomadically until I find a place I like enough to stick
          around in. Spoiler alert, I'm betting it's somewhere in the southwest
          United States! <br /><br />
          You can get to know the dogs over on The Wright Crew page, and you can
          follow more detailed bus progress on The Birdie Journey page. The
          coding should speak for itself and hopefully this site will get more
          impressive with time!
