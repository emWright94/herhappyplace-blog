      <p>
        A lot of you visiting this page know me in real life, but for those of
        you who don't, hello, I'm Em! I have three dogs and one cat and my
        favorite thing is to be outdoors with them. I'm mid bus-conversion right
        now, although mostly on hiatus for the winter. I enjoy plants, books,
        making art, learning new things, jamming out to [ often nerdy] music,
        exploring nature, and napping. I've created this space to take the place
        of my social media platforms. It also serves as good practice as I learn
        to code!
