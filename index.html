          A lot of you visiting this page know me in real life, but for those of
          you who don't: hello, I'm Em! I'm converting a school bus into a tiny
          home whilst simultaneously learning to code through a program called
          SheCodes. I had been posting my bus progress on Instagram but got off
          all Meta platforms recently because ya girl donâ€™t play those oligarchy
          games. Anyway that being said, I really missed updating friends and
          family through photos, so I figured might as well test my coding
          skills and put together a website to keep people in the loop! So yeah-
          welcome to the madness! ðŸ¤ª

          <br /><br />

          A little about me, for those who I don't know as well: I have three
          dogs and one cat, and my favorite thing is to be outdoors with them.
          I'm queer and use she/her pronouns. I enjoy animals, plants, books,
          making art, learning new things, jamming out to [often nerdy] music,
          exploring nature, annnnnd napping. ðŸ˜Œ I plan to live on the road with
          my little animal family once the bus is complete. The idea is we'll
          live nomadically until I find a place I like enough to stick around
          in. Spoiler alert, I'm betting it's somewhere in the southwest United
          States!

          <br /><br />

          You can get to know the dogs over on The Wright Crew page, and you can
          follow more detailed bus progress on The Birdie Journey page. The
          glimmers page has fluctuated between more of a blog and quick jots
          about things that make me happy, so check it out if you're curious
          about my life, I guess? The coding should speak for itself and
          hopefully this site will get more impressive with time! ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰
