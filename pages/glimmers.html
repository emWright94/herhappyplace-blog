          3/27/25 The blacksmithing class was AWESOME! My brother and I were
          exhausted by the end but we had such a great time. If you're ever near
          Franconia, NH, look up Iron Mike's Forge! Mike was kind, funny,
          patient, and helpful; I can't reccomend this man enough!
          <br />
          A smallish glimmer for the week was this gorgeous dried clump of
          flowers I noticed when I was at the park with the dogs.
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/brownPlant.jpg" />
          I can't wait to have a "real" camera to shoot with again! 3/21/25 I
          finished the classroom part of my work training today! Woohooooo! I
          also grabbed my brother and headed up to the White Mountains for an
          overnight and, tomorrow, a private blacksmithing class. We're both
          super stoked about it üòÅ I'm not usually one to enjoy the snow, but I
          must say that the light dusting that seems to stick to everything up
          here is quite lovely.
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/nhBridge.jpg" />
          <br />
          <br />
          3/20/25 Today's glimmer is simple- I passed The Big Test at work
          training! Woohoooo! I also passed a re-do test which was important as
          well. I don't learn as well from slides and lectures as I do from on
          the job training, and I test horribly, so these
          pass-it-or-lose-the-job tests are scary! I did it though and am
          feeling much more relaxed now.
          <br />
          <br />
          3/18/2025 Listen, sometimes you gotta find the silly little things to
          make your day! Last night I came home from work training frustrated
          and exhausted, so I decided to buy myself a little gifty that would
          help me feel better and take better care of myself!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/bentoBox.jpg" />
          LOOK HOW COLORFUL!! This cutie bento box type deal is totally meant
          for children, but ya know what, adults deserve bright colors too! It
          made me so happy during my lunch break (aka my 30 minutes of freedom
          from the torturous monotony of projector slides) today.
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/bingoKeychain.jpg" />
          The other day I found a little Bingo keychain (huge Bluey fan here)
          and that's been making me super happy as well. Gotta find the little
          bits of light each day folks!
          <br />
          <br />
          3/16/2025 I meant to post this the other day but forgot! After my
          absolute mess of an attempt at pastina in the rice cooker, I went back
          to something that I know how to do well and that I know is a fan
          favorite- spam masubi rice!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/spamMasubi.jpg" />
          Is it the best for us, nah, but it IS delicious! I added pineapple
          this time which was a huge win. Also got a nori sprinkle topping type
          deal from HMart which really made it look (and taste) fancy!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/15/2025 Y'all because I finally have steady income on the imminent
          horizon, I get to be back at the gym! If you were to go back in time
          and tell 13 year old me that that was a thing I was excited about she
          would laugh in your face, but here we are! Every inch of my body hurts
          but I feel the best I've felt in months. The gym I decided on has
          heavy bags so I can keep boxing (oh right, some of you don't know that
          my old gym was Title Boxing) AND they have a pool AAAAND a sauna! So
          fancy! Everyone I've interacted with there so far has been incredibly
          welcoming, kind, and unintimidating. Huge win! Here's to sore muscles!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/13/2025 Yeaaaah that did not go according to plan. Turns out making
          pastina in the rice cooker is NOT a go. Oh well, try again some other
          time! On the bright and totally unrelated side- I got my nose pierced
          the other day!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/nosePiercing.jpg" />
          <br />
          <br />
          03/12/2025 Today I'm attempting to make pastina, aka Italian
          Penicillin!! I'm cooking half an onion, 3 carrots, and 4 sticks of
          cellery in chicken stock until they're soft. Then I'll take the solids
          out and blend them and set aside. I think I'll then cook the pastina
          in the chicken broth and then add the pureed veggies back in? I'm
          doing this all in a rice cooker so it's a bit of an experiment!<br />Another
          happy thing for today is that I upgraded my terrarium to have more
          plants and moss.
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/terrarium.jpg" />Oh yeah, I
          havent told you about that yet, have I! I have a small terrarium I
          built for 5 adorable "milk cow" isopods. Think cow colored rolypoly
          bugs! They're super cute and the easiest pet I've ever had by far!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/11/2025 It got to 60¬∞ out today! Warm sunny weather calls for one
          thing: lizard time!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/lizardTime.jpg" />Lizard time
          is wehre I lay on the ground and simply soak up the sun. It's a 10/10
          experience, highly reccomend!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/07/2025 Today was a good day! I did a Taskr job in the morning and
          then headed into Boston for an interview. The job title is "ramp
          agent" at the airport- essentially doing all the stuff that happens
          outdoors under the plane. It sounded like fun; physically demanding,
          working in a team and outdoors, getting to work around
          internationally-traveling aircraft. The interview went swimmingly and
          at the end the hiring manager said he'd get me set up with a full
          application. I thought he meant I'd passed the first step and was on
          to round two, but then he congratulated me and I realized he'd meant I
          was hired! Gotta love my silly brain sometimes. It'll be about a month
          before I'm working, but I'm just excited to have consistent income on
          the horizon- gym membership here I come!
