          03/11/2025 It got to 60Â° out today! Warm sunny weather calls for one
          thing: lizard time!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/lizardTime.jpg" />Lizard time
          is wehre I lay on the ground and simply soak up the sun. It's a 10/10
          experience, highly reccomend!

          03/08/2025 The dogs and I went to a local park today to play fetch.

          They had a blast and I got some pretty sick photos of them!

          03/07/2025 Today was a good day! I did a Taskr job in the morning and
          then headed into Boston for an interview. The job title is "ramp
          agent" at the airport- essentially doing all the stuff that happens
          outdoors under the plane. It sounded like fun; physically demanding,
          working in a team and outdoors, getting to work around
          internationally-traveling aircraft. The interview went swimmingly and
          at the end the hiring manager said he'd get me set up with a full
          application. I thought he meant I'd passed the first step and was on
          to round two, but then he congratulated me and I realized he'd meant I
          was hired! Gotta love my silly brain sometimes. It'll be about a month
          before I'm working, but I'm just excited to have consistent income on
          the horizon- gym membership here I come!
