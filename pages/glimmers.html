          5/7/2025 Managed to get myself out of the house for a hike with the
          dogs today, which admittedly felt pretty good. At one point we were
          going up a slight hill and there was a young maple tree with its
          branches overhanging the path at eye level. The light was behind it
          and you could see every vein in the leaves. Simpley beautiful. üòå

          5/4/2025 [Mildly] spicy tuna rice bowls for dinner courtesy of yours
          truly! They were yummy and the kewpie mayo and nori mix topping really
          sealed the deal. I also had the privledge to take care of a couple
          extremely spoiled but equally awesome kitties this weekend. Silly
          mister T here gave me his belly to admire and even purred for me!

          <br />
          4/26/2025 With help from my super smart little bro, I figured out how
          to put a "scroll to top" button on the site! Woo hoo!
          <br />
          <br />
          4/25/25 This week I've been putting the subfloor in on the bus, which
          has involved a lot of trips to home depot, as well as renting a pickup
          from them to bring plywood and insulation home. I gotta shout out the
          Danvers Independece Way HD because everyone there that I've interacted
          with has been incredible. From my buddy Douglas who set me up with a
          pro account, guarded my carts while I ran around grabbing what I
          needed, and even went to find and retrieve something I needed himself,
          to the guys in the tool/truck rental room who were having a hell of a
          busy day but were still cheerful with me and had the jokes ready to
          go- every single person was a total love and made a potentially
          stressful task so much easier! What a glimmer filled week ü•∞
          <br />
          <br />
          4/21/2025 Best glimmer ever to report today!! About a year ago I made
          a crochet elephant out of a jersey cotton bedsheet I cut up. He was a
          little mishapen as he was one of my very first crochet projects, but
          adorable nonetheless. Since then he's been sitting on a shelf waiting
          for the right kid to come along for me to gift him to. Well folks,
          today was the day! My mum teaches two adorable little kiddos who have
          the most wonderful parents ever. On the way back from a trip to the
          bathroom, the mom and one of the kids noticed my art hanging on the
          wall and were so enthusiastic and kind about it. I grabbed a book of
          my art to share with them (LOVE getting kids excited about things
          they're interested in, and this one apparently loves art) and then
          realized they'd be the perfect kids for my elephant to go to! I tried
          to talk to the mom first but the little one snuck in and literally had
          their mouth hanging open when they saw the ellie. They were both SO
          excited and kiddo promised to share with the sibling who was
          mid-lesson. My heart is absolutely overflowing at their delight. ü§ó

          4/13/2025 Oh hey I'm 31 now, gross! Highlights of my birthday weekend
          included muffins from my favorite spot, clay creations, unexpected
          snow, and my boyfriend's mom bringing me home a cake! Cuteness all
          around, and despite the fact that I am not a huge fan of birthdays, it
          wasn't so bad all in all. ü•∞
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/birthdayCake.jpg" />
          <br />
          <br />
          4/8/2025 Naps. Sometimes the best part of the day is naptime and that
          is valid and a-okay. üòå
          <br />

          4/6/2025 Catch-up glimmer post ready GO!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/daffodil.jpg" />
          The way vines wrap around each other and twist together and together
          and together; someone blocking traffic so that I could turn onto a
          busy street; the sweetest older lady with a tiny chihuahua in her
          shopping cart basket, and her daughter who stopped to chat and told me
          that that dog and the others at home are her mom's BABIES and she
          checks on them with a camera when she's away; catching up with
          friends; spring flowers blooming; the dogs being soooo excited to see
          me even though I'd only been away from them for a short time; finding
          a salamander in the woods; friends' pets being excited to see me!
          <br />
          <br />
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/blacksmithing.jpg" />
          3/27/2025 The blacksmithing class was AWESOME! My brother and I were
          exhausted by the end but we had such a great time. If you're ever near
          Franconia, NH, look up
          <a target="blank" href="https://www.ironmikesforge.com/"
            >Iron Mike's Forge!</a
          >
          Mike was kind, funny, patient, and helpful; I can't reccomend this man
          enough!
          <br />
          A smallish glimmer for the week was this gorgeous dried clump of
          flowers I noticed when I was at the park with the dogs.
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/brownPlant.jpg" />
          I can't wait to have a "real" camera to shoot with again!
          <br />
          <br />
          3/21/2025 I finished the classroom part of my work training today!
          Woohooooo! I also grabbed my brother and headed up to the White
          Mountains for an overnight and, tomorrow, a private blacksmithing
          class. We're both super stoked about it üòÅ I'm not usually one to
          enjoy the snow, but I must say that the light dusting that seems to
          stick to everything up here is quite lovely.
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/nhBridge.jpg" />
          <br />
          <br />
          3/20/2025 Today's glimmer is simple- I passed The Big Test at work
          training! Woohoooo! I also passed a re-do test which was important as
          well. I don't learn as well from slides and lectures as I do from on
          the job training, and I test horribly, so these
          pass-it-or-lose-the-job tests are scary! I did it though and am
          feeling much more relaxed now.
          <br />
          <br />
          3/18/2025 Listen, sometimes you gotta find the silly little things to
          make your day! Last night I came home from work training frustrated
          and exhausted, so I decided to buy myself a little gifty that would
          help me feel better and take better care of myself!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/bentoBox.jpg" />
          LOOK HOW COLORFUL!! This
          <a target="blank" href="https://a.co/d/cE0YCjx">cutie bento box</a>
          type deal is totally meant for children, but ya know what, adults
          deserve bright colors too! It made me so happy during my lunch break
          (aka my 30 minutes of freedom from the torturous monotony of projector
          slides) today.
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/bingoKeychain.jpg" />
          The other day I found a little Bingo keychain (huge Bluey fan here)
          and that's been making me super happy as well. Gotta find the little
          bits of light each day folks!
          <br />
          <br />
          3/16/2025 I meant to post this the other day but forgot! After my
          absolute mess of an attempt at pastina in the rice cooker, I went back
          to something that I know how to do well and that I know is a fan
          favorite- spam masubi rice!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/spamMasubi.jpg" />
          Is it the best for us, nah, but it IS delicious! I added pineapple
          this time which was a huge win. Also got a nori sprinkle topping type
          deal from HMart which really made it look (and taste) fancy!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/15/2025 Y'all because I finally have steady income on the imminent
          horizon, I get to be back at the gym! If you were to go back in time
          and tell 13 year old me that that was a thing I was excited about she
          would laugh in your face, but here we are! Every inch of my body hurts
          but I feel the best I've felt in months. The gym I decided on has
          heavy bags so I can keep boxing (oh right, some of you don't know that
          my old gym was Title Boxing) AND they have a pool AAAAND a sauna! So
          fancy! Everyone I've interacted with there so far has been incredibly
          welcoming, kind, and unintimidating. Huge win! Here's to sore muscles!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/13/2025 Yeaaaah that did not go according to plan. Turns out making
          pastina in the rice cooker is NOT a go. Oh well, try again some other
          time! On the bright and totally unrelated side- I got my nose pierced
          the other day!
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/nosePiercing.jpg" />
          <br />
          <br />
          03/12/2025 Today I'm attempting to make pastina, aka Italian
          Penicillin!! I'm cooking half an onion, 3 carrots, and 4 sticks of
          cellery in chicken stock until they're soft. Then I'll take the solids
          out and blend them and set aside. I think I'll then cook the pastina
          in the chicken broth and then add the pureed veggies back in? I'm
          doing this all in a rice cooker so it's a bit of an experiment!<br />Another
          happy thing for today is that I upgraded my terrarium to have more
          plants and moss.
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/terrarium.jpg" />Oh yeah, I
          havent told you about that yet, have I! I have a small terrarium I
          built for 5 adorable "dairy cow" isopods. Think cow colored rolypoly
          bugs! They're super cute and the easiest pet I've ever had by far!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/11/2025 It got to 60¬∞ out today! Warm sunny weather calls for one
          thing: lizard time!
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/lizardTime.jpg" />Lizard time
          is where I lay on the ground and simply soak up the sun. It's a 10/10
          experience, highly reccomend!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/07/2025 Today was a good day! I did a Taskr job in the morning and
          then headed into Boston for an interview. The job title is "ramp
          agent" at the airport- essentially doing all the stuff that happens
          outdoors under the plane. It sounded like fun; physically demanding,
          working in a team and outdoors, getting to work around
          internationally-traveling aircraft. The interview went swimmingly and
          at the end the hiring manager said he'd get me set up with a full
          application. I thought he meant I'd passed the first step and was on
          to round two, but then he congratulated me and I realized he'd meant I
          was hired! Gotta love my silly brain sometimes. It'll be about a month
          before I'm working, but I'm just excited to have consistent income on
          the horizon- gym membership here I come!
