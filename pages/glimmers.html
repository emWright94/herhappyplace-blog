          3/16/2025 I meant to post this the other day but forgot! After my
          absolute mess of an attempt at pastina in the rice cooker, I went back
          to something that I know how to do well and that I know is a fan
          favorite- spam masubi rice!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/spamMasubi.jpg" />
          Is it the best for us, nah, but it IS delicious! I added pineapple
          this time which was a huge win. Also got a nori sprinkle topping type
          deal from HMart which really made it look (and taste) fancy!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/15/2025 Y'all because I finally have steady income on the imminent
          horizon, I get to be back at the gym! If you were to go back in time
          and tell 13 year old me that that was a thing I was excited about she
          would laugh in your face, but here we are! Every inch of my body hurts
          but I feel the best I've felt in months. The gym I decided on has
          heavy bags so I can keep boxing (oh right, some of you don't know that
          my old gym was Title Boxing) AND they have a pool AAAAND a sauna! So
          fancy! Everyone I've interacted with there so far has been incredibly
          welcoming, kind, and unintimidating. Huge win! Here's to sore muscles!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/13/2025 Yeaaaah that did not go according to plan. Turns out making
          pastina in the rice cooker is NOT a go. Oh well, try again some other
          time! On the bright and totally unrelated side- I got my nose pierced
          the other day!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/nosePiercing.jpg" />
          <br />
          <br />
          03/12/2025 Today I'm attempting to make pastina, aka Italian
          Penicillin!! I'm cooking half an onion, 3 carrots, and 4 sticks of
          cellery in chicken stock until they're soft. Then I'll take the solids
          out and blend them and set aside. I think I'll then cook the pastina
          in the chicken broth and then add the pureed veggies back in? I'm
          doing this all in a rice cooker so it's a bit of an experiment!<br />Another
          happy thing for today is that I upgraded my terrarium to have more
          plants and moss.
          <img class="blogImgLeft" src="../images/terrarium.jpg" />Oh yeah, I
          havent told you about that yet, have I! I have a small terrarium I
          built for 5 adorable "milk cow" isopods. Think cow colored rolypoly
          bugs! They're super cute and the easiest pet I've ever had by far!
          <br />
          <br />
          03/11/2025 It got to 60Â° out today! Warm sunny weather calls for one
          thing: lizard time!
          <img class="blogImgRight" src="../images/lizardTime.jpg" />Lizard time
          is wehre I lay on the ground and simply soak up the sun. It's a 10/10
          experience, highly reccomend!
          <br />

          03/07/2025 Today was a good day! I did a Taskr job in the morning and
          then headed into Boston for an interview. The job title is "ramp
          agent" at the airport- essentially doing all the stuff that happens
          outdoors under the plane. It sounded like fun; physically demanding,
          working in a team and outdoors, getting to work around
          internationally-traveling aircraft. The interview went swimmingly and
          at the end the hiring manager said he'd get me set up with a full
          application. I thought he meant I'd passed the first step and was on
          to round two, but then he congratulated me and I realized he'd meant I
          was hired! Gotta love my silly brain sometimes. It'll be about a month
          before I'm working, but I'm just excited to have consistent income on
          the horizon- gym membership here I come!
