            her sensitive older brother. She is my heart and soul dog, truly.

            colored kitty born in 2020 who showed up on my doorstep at about 8

            is the most affectionate of my crew; he's sweet, silly, talkative,
            and snuggly. He loves to hide when I bring the dogs back in from
            walks and then zoom out and pounce on them. He also loves to sleep
            on my face.

            that people find it adorable and so she does it more often to get
            even more attention. I wouldn't be surprised if that was what she

            Tiny dogs can do stuff too! Encouraging Lu to do the same sort of
            stuff the "big dogs" do really builds her confidence, not to mention
            that I love seeing her light up when she conqueres a harder
            challenge. I also love to let Lu explore on a longline. Having her
            attached to me keeps her safe from hawks and from simply wandering
            off, as she is apt to do, and having said attachment be a 30ft line
            gives her the freedom she so desperately wants!
