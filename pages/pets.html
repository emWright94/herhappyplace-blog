            adopt him out to a friend- thank goodness THAT didn't work out!). He
            is the most affectionate of my crew; he's sweet, silly, talkative,
            and snuggly. He loves to hide when I bring the dogs back in from
            walks and then zoom out and pounce on them. He also loves to sleep
            on my face.

            My little GREMLIN- I can't! I've never met a dog who sticks their
            tounge out as much as Lu does. It's almost like she's figured out
            that people find it adorable and so she does it more often to get
            even more attention. I wouldn't be surprised if that was what she
            chose to direct her limited intelect to! ðŸ˜œ

            Tiny dogs can do stuff too! Encouraging Lu to do the same sort of
            stuff the "big dogs" do really builds her confidence, not to mention
            that I love seeing her light up when she conqueres a harder
            challenge. I also love to let Lu explore on a longline. Having her
            attached to me keeps her safe from hawks and from simply wandering
            off, as she is apt to do, and having said attachment be a 30ft line
            gives her the freedom she so desperately wants!
