          Birdie, aka "The Bird", is my 2000 TC1000 Bluebird school bus. She
          hails from Alabama and is slowly being converted into "home" for me
          and my crew. I flew 1400 miles to a state I'd never been to to pick
          her up sight unseen (except through photos and videos). I'd had a
          local mechanic check her out for me and he liked the look of her so I
          decided to go for it. My gamble paid off- Birdie is a solidly built
          girl with a strong engine (Cummins 5.9) and excellent transmission
          (Alison). She had zero rust on her undercarraige as she'd been in the
          south for her entire career. Below is a sort of photo journal of my
          progress with building her out so far. The most recent work is at the
          top, so scroll all the way down if you want to start at the beginning
          of our story! (I'll learn how to set the page up better eventually-
          I'm still learning coding basics so ya get what ya get for now üòÖ).
          Enjoy, and thanks for your interest!
          <br />
          <br />
          P.S. I'm way behind on posting progress here because I didn't start
          this site project until I was already about 5 months into the build!
          I'll get caught up little by little- stay tuned! You'll probably want
          to start at the bottom and work your way up (until I learn how to code
          multiple pages.. within.. a page?).

            Once the floor was primed, I only had one more thing to do to make
            the bus completely watertight: the skylights! I had decided I wanted
            to install bubble skylights where both emergency exit hatches were.
            This involved climbing up to the roof of the bus- a thusfar
            unexplored world! BOY was it dirty up there!

            The whole inside of the bus was instantly transformed by the

            shoutout to my partner for helping me figure out how to go about
            installing these badboys. We did the first one together and it was
            definitely trial by fire! The second one I was able to do on my own
            because we'd worked out all the kinks together. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

            The next big project was to use the angle grinder on the floors to
            get the worst of the rust off, then paint them with a
            rust-prohibiting primer for protection, then glue down pennies over
            all the holes in the floor ($1.20 in pennies), then run over
            everything with a second coat of primer.

            BUT I knew I wanted to be able to hang a hammock even when the bus
            was all built out, so I did some rough estimating and figured out
            where she'd fit, and bought some heavy duty hardware to install
            permanent mounting points that I'd be able to access even once the
            ceiling was installed.

            Ok so the ceiling. Woof. The ceiling was sheetmetal attached with
            rivets to the ribs (steel framework the roof also attaches to) of
            the bus. But not, like, a few rivets. Total in the bus (including
            walls) I estimated there were about 700 of those fuckers. For the
            walls I used an air hammer/chisel to disconect the heads and then
            bust them off. For the ceiling though the legerage wasn't right to
            use that tool, so I used an angle grinder with a variety of wheels
            on it. I felt like such a badass getting comfortable using such a
            potentially dangerous tool!

            Next to go after the AC fans (which lived under the bus) were the AC
            units themselves (inside the bus). I was done removing the walls at
            this point and had started on the ceiling, but in order to get two
            of the panels down, the AC units had to come out. This was a bit of
            a bear of a project, but we got it done (ace bestie and I).

            the radiator. I successfully shortened the circuit to exclude all
            the hose that had previously led back to the heater in question.

            Once I got all the rubber flooring up, I set my eye to ripping up
            the plywood subfloor. Unfortunately for me there were some very
            stubborn L brackets bolted thru the plywood and the floor of the bus
            to the underside. The sawzall and I became besties! üôÉ

            First step was to rip up all the rubber flooring that was covering
            the plywood, which in turn was sitting on top of the sheetmetal that
            made up the floor of the bus.

            My brother and his landlord generously agreed to let me house Birdie
            at his apartment, so after her oil change and a trip to Cummins, I
            got her settled into her new home.

            Once we made it I took her to a local shop for an oil change and
            they lifted her up! I was able to walk around underneath and point
            at things and ask what they were- super cool.
