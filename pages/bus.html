          Birdie, aka "The Bird", is my 2000 TC1000 Bluebird school bus. She
          hails from Alabama and is slowly being converted into "home" for me
          and my crew. I flew 1400 miles to a state I'd never been to to pick
          her up sight unseen (except through photos and videos). I'd had a
          local mechanic check her out for me and he liked the look of her so I
          decided to go for it. My gambol paid off- Birdie is a solidly built
          girl with a strong engine (Cummins 5.9) and excellent transmission
          (Alison). She had zero rust on her undercarraige as she'd been in the
          south for her entire career. Below is a sort of photo journal of my
          progress with building her out so far. The most recent work is at the
          top, so scroll all the way down if you want to start at the beginning
          of our story! (I'll learn how to set the page up better eventually-
          I'm still learning coding basics so ya get what ya get for now ðŸ˜…).
          Enjoy, and thanks for your interest!
          <br />
          <br />
          P.S. I'm way behind on posting progress here because I didn't start
          this site project until I was already about 5 months into the build!
          I'll get caught up little by little- stay tuned!
