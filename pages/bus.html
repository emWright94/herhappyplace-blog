          Birdie, aka "The Bird", is my 2000 TC1000 Bluebird school bus. She
          hails from Alabama and is slowly but surely being converted into a
          home on wheels for me and my animal crew. I flew 1,400 miles to a
          state I'd never been to to pick her up sight unseen (except through
          photos and videos). Pre-purchase I had a local mechanic check her out
          for me just to be safe. He liked the look of her and she checked all
          my boxes, so I decided to go for it. My gamble paid off- Birdie is a
          solidly built girl with a strong engine (Cummins 5.9) and excellent
          transmission (Alison). She had zero rust on her undercarriage as she'd
          been in the south for her entire career. Below is a sort of photo
          journal of my progress with building her out so far. The most recent
          work is at the top, so you’ll need to scroll all the way down if you
          want to start at the beginning of our story! (I'll learn how to set
          the page up better eventually- I'm still learning coding basics so ya
          get what ya get for now 😅). Enjoy, and thanks for your interest!

            This morning's starter project was clearing out the junk in this
            bench storage space, vaccuming thoroughly, and putting down a layer
            of rubber flooring (rescued from a dumpster, believe it or not!). I
            also filled out the insulation in the wall behind the bench and
            walled off the back wall. Took the pic a little too soon- whoops!

            I was feeling really overwhelmed by the end of the day yesterday and
            wasn't sure why. When I took a second to calm myself and reflect, I
            realized that I was overstimulated by the construction mess that had
            taken over the bus. I hadn't been cleaning up because I knew I'd
            just make more of a mess the next day (especially from cutting the
            cement board- that shh is DUSTY). My AuDHD highly visual brain is
            much calmer and more focused in a clean neat environment though, so
            I spent about an hour and a half deep cleaning and organizing. The
            relief I felt when I was done was craaaazy!

            Today I also got the cement board cut for my sink counter, and the

            tiled anything in my life and literally had to google what supplies
            I needed and what the difference between mortar and grout is. Stay
            tuned for chaos! 😅

            I'm still not completely decided on what I'm going to use for the
            walls in the bathroom, but I knew that I needed to waterproof the
            structural under layer of wall regardless. Redguard goes on pink
            with a roller and gets darker as it dries. Two coats down, probably
            a few more to go! Oh and I didn't forget the wall beneath the
            windows, I just need to take that wall off to run pipes, so I'm
            going to do that first and then "guard" it.

            I've realized that I'm going to need an HVAC profesh to do the final
            set-up steps for the system. If you're in eastern Mass and know

            then tile over that. I'm excited to see how it'll look done, but

            I was so excited to finish insulating the outer wall in my shower
            and put the wall base layer up... only to realize that it needs to
            come back down so I can run water pipes behind it. Whoops! At least
            it's just a matter of taking out a handful of screws.

            While I was already working on stuff in the back, I figured I might
            as well lay down the rest of the framing for the bed platform. If
            you can, imagine this whole area covered with plywood. The front
            right corner under the bed will be the Dog Nook, which is done
            except for paint. The left side under the bed will be a 100 gallon
            fresh water tank. The back right under the bed space will be my
            garage equivalent- tools, ladder, outdoor gear. At this point the
            back is ready to be spray-foam insulated and have walls the bed
            platform put in- WOAH!

            isn't enought clearence above it, and it just feels bulky. I decided
            to mount it on the back wall in the bedroom instead, but that meant
            that the back wall needed to have some studs put up. Tadaaaaa!

            Ok ok this I'm honestly so proud of! I decided I wanted to reuse the
            original dashboard since it's a super awkward shape that would have
            been hard to recreate out of wood. That being said, I knew I was
            removing the heater that was up front, which meant a lot of the
            cavity space within the dash wouldn't be used. One of the biggest
            things about living in a skoolie is that you nevvvvver want to waste
            space. I decided to modify the dash by opening up sections to be
            cubbies so that I'll have more room for little-stuff storage, just
            like the glove compartments in a standard vehicle! I used the angle
            grinder to cut [surprisingly straight] lines for long cubby spaces,
            and then used the same tool to smooth off the edges. After I had
            sprayed everything a glossy black, I used some edge trim stuff
            (traditionally used for car doors as a seal) to further safety-proof
            the edges and to make the whole thing look more finished. I'm so
            stoked with how it turned out!!

            preventative paint. They look glossy and good as new now!

            house since my mum was a kid! I claimed it when their house was sold

            two doors that hinged on either side and closed to each other in the
            middle. I cut one side off its hinges and used thick aluminium and
            bolts to attach the loose door to the still-hinged door. I am SO
            pleased with how it turned out! Once the rain here stops I'll be
            able to spray paint all the hardware and use the grinder to take the
            ends of the bolts off for a more finished look.

            4/29/25: Today (that's right, the Birdie Blog is officially caught

            up some of the leftover insulation to use inside my walls. The plan
            is to use sprayfoam around this, possibly with another layer of foam
            board in there too.

            Shoutout to my truck rental guys at a certain home improvement store
            & to my guy D who guarded my 2 carts worth of stuff while I went and
            pulled the truck up, AND to the girl with her nails done who
            fearlessly helped me load plywood into the truck. Other than having
            to drive a Ford (fight me 😒), it was a successful day! I got half
            the foam insulation in and one piece of plywood, and called it a
            day.

            Ok so the ceiling. Woof. The ceiling was sheetmetal attached with
            rivets to the ribs (steel framework the roof also attaches to) of
            the bus. But not, like, a few rivets. Total in the bus (including
            walls) I estimated there were about 700 of those fuckers. For the
            walls I used an air hammer/chisel to disconect the heads and then
            bust them off. For the ceiling though the legerage wasn't right to
            use that tool, so I used an angle grinder with a variety of wheels
            on it. I felt like such a badass getting comfortable using such a

            Next to go after the AC fans (which lived under the bus) were the AC
            units themselves (inside the bus). I was done removing the walls at
            this point and had started on the ceiling, but in order to get two
            of the panels down, the AC units had to come out. This was a bit of
            a bear of a project, but we got it done (ace bestie and I).

            As I ground bolts out of the floor, the AC fans underneath
            disconnected and eventually fell. I'll be putting in a minisplit for
            heat/AC so the existing units were not necessary.

            Along the same lines as the walls, these wiring casings and higher

            bolts were too deep in the wells to be able to get to, so they had
            to be cut off with the angle grinder. EESH. Peep my rockstar bestie

            At vaguely the same time as all this, I rented a hammerdrill and
            went to town on the wall rivets. BTW, in total there were about 750
            rivets on this dang bus (including those securing the ceiling, as
            well as the walls). Spoiler alert, they're all gone now- ya girl's a

            Another side project I was working on at the time was removing the
            back heater, which involved the scariest thing I'd done up to this
            point- cutting through and removing hoses that connected back into
            the radiator. I successfully shortened the circuit to exclude all
            the hose that had previously led back to the heater in question.

            While I was working on taking up the subfloor, I had a few other
            projects going as well. One was taking a heatgun and a putty knife
            to the glue that was on the steps after I got the rubber step liners
            up.

            Finally I got one full sheet of the subfloor plywood up and that got
            me motivated. The stuff bolted through it had been seriously
            disheartening because I was still a newb at this point and wasn't
            sure how to go about tackling it! It's wild to think how much I've
            learned since then.

            Once I got all the rubber flooring up, I set my eye to ripping up

            stubborn L brackets bolted thru the plywood and the floor of the bus
            to the underside. The sawzall and I became besties! 🙃
