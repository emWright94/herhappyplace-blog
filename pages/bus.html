          Birdie, aka "The Bird", is my 2000 TC1000 Bluebird school bus. She
          hails from Alabama and is slowly being converted into "home" for me
          and my crew. I flew 1400 miles to a state I'd never been to to pick
          her up sight unseen (except through photos and videos). I'd had a
          local mechanic check her out for me and he liked the look of her so I
          decided to go for it. My gambol paid off- Birdie is a solidly built
          girl with a strong engine (Cummins 5.9) and excellent transmission
          (Alison). She had zero rust on her undercarraige as she'd been in the
          south for her entire career. Below is a sort of photo journal of my
          progress with building her out so far. The most recent work is at the
          top, so scroll all the way down if you want to start at the beginning
          of our story! (I'll learn how to set the page up better eventually-
          I'm still learning coding basics so ya get what ya get for now 😅).
          Enjoy, and thanks for your interest!
          <br />
          <br />
          P.S. I'm way behind on posting progress here because I didn't start
          this site project until I was already about 5 months into the build!
          I'll get caught up little by little- stay tuned! You'll want to start
          at the bottom and work your way up (until I learn how to code multiple
          pages.. within.. a page?).

            Along the same lines as the walls, these wiring casings and higher
            up brackets had to come down. Those things were a PAIN because the
            bolts were too deep in the wells to be able to get to, so they had
            to be cut off with the angle grinder. EESH. Peep my rockstar bestie
            helping me out tho?? 🥰

            I punched the rivets off and then the use a crowbar to pry the wall
            panels off their base. "It was a pain" would be the understatement
            of the year, hah!

            At vaguely the same time as all this, I rented a hammerdrill and
            went to town on the wall rivets. BTW, in total there were about 750
            rivets on this dang bus (including those securing the ceiling, as
            well as the walls). Spoiler alert, they're all gone now- ya girl's a
            badass 😎

            Another side project I was working on at the time was removing the
            back heater, which involved the scariest thing I'd done up to this
            point- cutting through and removing hoses that connected back into
            the radiator. I successfully shortened the circuit to exclude all
            the hose that had previously led back to the heater in question.

            I also used the heat gun to remove the "SCHOOL BUS" lettering on the
            sides of the bus. It was tedius, but it did work!

            While I was working on taking up the subfloor, I had a few other
            projects going as well. One was taking a heatgun and a putty knife
            to the glue that was on the steps after I got the rubber step liners
            up.

          <figcaption>
            Finally I got one full sheet of the subfloor plywood up and that got
            me motivated. The stuff bolted through it had been seriously
            disheartening because I was still a newb at this point and wasn't
            sure how to go about tackling it! It's wild to think how much I've
            learned since then.

            Once I got all the rubber flooring up, I set my eye to ripping up
            the plywood subfloor. Unfortunately for me there were some very
            stubborn L brackets bolted thru the plywood and the floor of the bus
            to the underside. The sawzall and I became besties! 🙃

            First step was to rip up all the rubber flooring that was covering
            the plywood, which in turn was sitting on top of the sheetmetal that
            made up the floor of the bus.

            Once we made it I took her to a local shop for an oil change and
