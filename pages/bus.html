          Birdie, aka "The Bird", is my 2000 TC1000 Bluebird school bus. She
          hails from Alabama and is slowly but surely being converted into a
          home on wheels for me and my animal crew. I flew 1,400 miles to a
          state I'd never been to to pick her up sight unseen (except through
          photos and videos). Pre-purchase I had a local mechanic check her out
          for me just to be safe. He liked the look of her and she checked all
          my boxes, so I decided to go for it. My gamble paid off- Birdie is a
          solidly built girl with a strong engine (Cummins 5.9) and excellent
          transmission (Alison). She had zero rust on her undercarriage as she'd
          been in the south for her entire career. Below is a sort of photo
          journal of my progress with building her out so far. The most recent
          work is at the top, so you’ll need to scroll all the way down if you
          want to start at the beginning of our story! (I'll learn how to set
          the page up better eventually- I'm still learning coding basics so ya
          get what ya get for now 😅). Enjoy, and thanks for your interest!

            While I was already working on stuff in the back, I figured I might
            as well lay down the rest of the framing for the bed platform. If
            you can, imagine this whole area covered with plywood. The front
            right corner under the bed will be the Dog Nook, which is done
            except for paint. The left side under the bed will be a 100 gallon
            fresh water tank. The back right under the bed space will be my
            garage equivalent- tools, ladder, outdoor gear. At this point the
            back is ready to be spray-foam insulated and have walls the bed
            platform put in- WOAH!

            I temp-mounted my minisplit where I originally wanted and decided I
            didn't like it there (above the kitchen counter area). There really
            isn't enought clearence above it, and it just feels bulky. I decided
            to mount it on the back wall in the bedroom instead, but that meant
            that the back wall needed to have some studs put up. Tadaaaaa!

            I picked an exterior color!!! I went with this caramel camel khacki
            sort of deal, with the thought that it's warm toned but neutral, and
            will look excellent behind the fun hippy stripes I hope to add
            eventually! It unfortunately covers like shit, meaning it will need
            a LOT of coats to be completely opaque. Live and learn! 🫠

            Ok ok this I'm honestly so proud of! I decided I wanted to reuse the
            original dashboard since it's a super awkward shape that would have
            been hard to recreate out of wood. That being said, I knew I was
            removing the heater that was up front, which meant a lot of the
            cavity space within the dash wouldn't be used. One of the biggest
            things about living in a skoolie is that you nevvvvver want to waste
            space. I decided to modify the dash by opening up sections to be
            cubbies so that I'll have more room for little-stuff storage, just
            like the glove compartments in a standard vehicle! I used the angle
            grinder to cut [surprisingly straight] lines for long cubby spaces,
            and then used the same tool to smooth off the edges. After I had
            sprayed everything a glossy black, I used some edge trim stuff
            (traditionally used for car doors as a seal) to further safety-proof
            the edges and to make the whole thing look more finished. I'm so
            stoked with how it turned out!!

            My initial tangle with mounting solar panels resulted in me filling
            in holes I had drilled in the roof. I got smart after that and used
            a template to sketch out (literally right onto the room) where all
            the panels should go.

            two doors that hinged on either side and closed to each other in the
            middle. I cut one side off its hinges and used thick aluminium and
            bolts to attach the loose door to the still-hinged door. I am SO
            pleased with how it turned out! Once the rain here stops I'll be
            able to spray paint all the hardware and use the grinder to take the
            ends of the bolts off for a more finished look.

            Getting Caught Up: With a little help getting started, I built
            frames for my couch bench things! They're so much bigger in real
            life than in my head and I'm so happy with them.

            4/29/25: Today (that's right, the Birdie Blog is officially caught
            up!) I cut some lumber to frame out more of my walls. I also broke
            up some of the leftover insulation to use inside my walls. The plan
            is to use sprayfoam around this, possibly with another layer of foam
            board in there too.

            feet of space at the front, and the steps, I have a subfloor! WOO!

            The next step was putting down insulation and plywood for my
            subfloor!!! This involved renting a pickup for an hour, as the
            materials needed were not going to fit in my suv- by a longshot.
            Shoutout to my truck rental guys at a certain home improvement store
            & to my guy D who guarded my 2 carts worth of stuff while I went and
            pulled the truck up, AND to the girl with her nails done who
            fearlessly helped me load plywood into the truck. Other than having
            to drive a Ford (fight me 😒), it was a successful day! I got half
            the foam insulation in and one piece of plywood, and called it a
            day.

            Once the floor was primed, I only had one more thing to do to make

            to install bubble skylights where both emergency exit hatches were.

            ceiling was installed.

            Ok so the ceiling. Woof. The ceiling was sheetmetal attached with
            rivets to the ribs (steel framework the roof also attaches to) of
            the bus. But not, like, a few rivets. Total in the bus (including
            walls) I estimated there were about 700 of those fuckers. For the
            walls I used an air hammer/chisel to disconect the heads and then
            bust them off. For the ceiling though the legerage wasn't right to
            use that tool, so I used an angle grinder with a variety of wheels
            on it. I felt like such a badass getting comfortable using such a
            potentially dangerous tool!

            this point and had started on the ceiling, but in order to get two
            of the panels down, the AC units had to come out. This was a bit of

            Finally I got one full sheet of the subfloor plywood up and that got
            me motivated. The stuff bolted through it had been seriously
            disheartening because I was still a newb at this point and wasn't
            sure how to go about tackling it! It's wild to think how much I've
            learned since then.

            Once I got all the rubber flooring up, I set my eye to ripping up
            the plywood subfloor. Unfortunately for me there were some very
            stubborn L brackets bolted thru the plywood and the floor of the bus
            to the underside. The sawzall and I became besties! 🙃

            First step was to rip up all the rubber flooring that was covering
            the plywood, which in turn was sitting on top of the sheetmetal that
            made up the floor of the bus.

            My brother and his landlord generously agreed to let me house Birdie
            at his apartment, so after her oil change and a trip to Cummins, I
            got her settled into her new home.

            Once we made it I took her to a local shop for an oil change and
            they lifted her up! I was able to walk around underneath and point
            at things and ask what they were- super cool.

            The drive home was a little rough and ended up taking about 5 days,
