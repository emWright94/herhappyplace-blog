            Today was a good day! I did a Taskr job in the morning and then
            headed into Boston for an interview. The job title is "ramp agent"
            at the airport- essentially doing all the stuff that happens
            outdoors under the plane. It sounded like fun; physically demanding,
            working in a team and outdoors, getting to work around
            internationally-traveling aircraft. The interview went swimmingly
            and at the end the hiring manager said he'd get me set up with a
            full application. I thought he meant I'd passed the first step and
            was on to round two, but then he congratulated me and I realized
            he'd meant I was hired! Gotta love my silly brain sometimes. It'll
            be about a month before I'm working, but I'm just excited to have
            consistent income on the horizon- gym membership here I come!
